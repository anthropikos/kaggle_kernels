However, when comparing with a similarity matrix approach's RMSE baseline (RMSE = 1.2642784503423288), the result was not what I would expect from what the Netflix Prize's winning team used as the basis of their approach. To the winning team's argument, they did refined their model using a lot more than just the basic matrix factorication.\n","\n","Additionally, the Sci-kit Learn's Non-negative Matrix Factorication (NMF) (Sklearn.Decomposition.NMF, n.d.) has more restriction than the method used by the Netflix Prize winning team. Most importantly is the \"strictly positive\" aspect of the NMF, which forces it to \"learn the parts of the [data]\" (Lee & Seung, 1999). In contrast, similarity matrices as used in the RMSE baseline and the Netflix Prize winning team create a much denser representation instead of just \"learning the parts.\"\n","\n","The \"parts based representation\" (Lee & Seung, 1999) has a lot of benefits, specifically the handling of sparse data and better interpretability. In contrast, similar methods such as Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Vector Quantization (VQ) have a much harder or non-intuitive interpretation in terms of its encoding matrix (Lee & Seung, 1999).\n","\n","## Future improvements\n","\n","This analysis could be improved upon in the following ways: \n","\n","- Include the implementation of the similarity-matrix approach (which currently resides offline [somewhere on my machine...])\n","- Test different NMF hyperparameters including the number of components of which the latent dimension uses. Currently, it just uses the convenient n_components=5.\n","- Test the different initialization algorithm of the NMF. Could there be one that is more beneficial for a sparse rating matrix and instead of putting most of the zeros to the factorication matrix would balance the number of zeros between the transformed matrix and the factorication matrix.\n","\n","## References\n","\n","- Koren, Y., Bell, R., & Volinsky, C.
