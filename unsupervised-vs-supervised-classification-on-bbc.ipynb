    "# Comparing Unsupervised- and Supervised-Classification on [OLD] BBC News Articles\n",
    "\n",
    "Author: Anthony Lee\n",
    "(Feel free to reach out on comments and/or critical feedbacks~)\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learn what matrix factorization (MF) in the context of unsupervised- and supervised-learning.\n",
    "2. Challenge myself to make the code more reusable and understandable.\n",
    "3. Have fun - What's the point if not to have some fun???\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix factorization (MF) shown by the winning team of Netflix Prize's recommender system is NOT Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD). However, they are very similar in that SVD is a form of MF, but not the other way around. The TL;DR version is that MF decomposes to two matrices whereas SVD decomposes into three matrices. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook investigates building MF in a unsupervised-learning and supervised-learning context by changing the classifier at the very last step of the pipeline. \n",
    "In the unsupervised-learning context, MF is being used similar to Pricipal Component Analysis (PCA) or K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) clustering. At a high level, we are projecting each feature vector onto a subspace with a dimension size matching the number of categories that we would like to see (i.e., five categories).\n",
    "Conversely, in the supervised-learning context, MF is being used as a transformer to encode the feature vectors onto a smaller latent space, and a classifier is then used to learn the mapping between this latent space to the final prediction space (i.e., dimension of five categories).\n",
    "\n",
    "To focus on the three goals set forth above, I was not too concerned in tuning the hyperparameters to achieve the best prediction score. Instead, I focused on the using some intuition to create a search space and then attempted to modularize the components of the pipeline so that the pipeline can be easily improved. To satisfy this goal required me to get a better understanding of how scikit-learn was designed architecturally and conform to its interface. The result is instead of using scikit-learn as a collection of functions, I used it as a framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, to have some fun I tested a HUGE search space that resulted in Kaggle terminating my notebook run because it ran for more than 12 hours (oops... I have contributed some unecessary carbon to the environment!) I eventually opted for using the `RandomizedSearchCV` instead so that my notebook won't be terminated. If you're interested in seeing the notebook termination and differences between a comprehensive `GridSearchCV` vs `RandomizedSearchCV`, feel free to reference version 7-9 of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improve the hyperparameter tuning for SVC to improve the prediction performance to 95% accuracy (currently around 71%)\n",
    "- Conduct a similar analysis on articles from the last five years because trends have changed drastically since this original dataset.\n",
    "- Consider leveraging GPU/TPU to fit and transform the dataset.\n",
    "- In a separate project do some data mining for articles from the last five years. \n",
    "- Analyze social media posts instead of news articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "- All the function and class definitions\n",
