## Summary
This project investigates the potential of using a deep learning model for end-to-end feature extraction of the LFP signal in patients with essential tremors, further extrapolating the features to other similar movement disorders such as Parkinson's Disease.

## Result
The model shows convergence in training-loss and validation-loss after 6 epochs. Further, investigation is needed to understand the feature extracted by each of the convolutional layers.
