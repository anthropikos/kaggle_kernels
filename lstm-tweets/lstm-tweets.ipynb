Instead of a bag-of-words approach, the LSTM model retains memory of what it was trained on and thus can learn from the sequences of words. Each tweet is read from a CSV and then tokenized, lemmatized, vectorized using SpaCy's `en_core_web_lg` pipeline and then used to train the LSTM model built in PyTorch. The training is unbatched and CPU based. The model takes approximately 7.5 minutes to train on a quad-core Intel Xeon 2.20Ghz CPU, and was used to inference on a test dataset achieving an F1 score of 0.803. Further, the notebook discusses some of the learnings from the development of the model and presents some suggestions on future improvements.\n","\n","## Methods\n","### Train / Validation Split\n","For overfitting detection, the training dataset was split by 90/10 with 90% of the data being training data and the remaining 10% being held out for validation. The split stratifies based on the training data's target ensuring that the proportion of diaster to non-disaster is equal between the training set and valdiation set.\n","\n","### NLP Pipeline\n","SpaCy was used for the text processing step. Using the tools and pretrained model in the `en_core_web_lg` pipeline, each tweet is tokenized, lemmatized, and vectorized for the deep learning model's consumption. The decision to include a lemmatization step is to reduce the domain space of each tweet as words retain similar meanings when reduced to its lemma form. The `en_core_web_lg` pipeline is approximatley 382MB with 685,000 keys and 343,000 unique vectors of 300 dimensions. The output of the pipeline is thus a two dimensional array of N x D where N is the sequence legnth of tweet, and D is the dimension of the token vector (300).\n","\n","### LSTM Architecture in PyTorch\n","The LSTM model is constructed using PyTorch and consists of one LSTM layer, one fully-connected (FC) layer, and a sigmoid activation function. The LSTM layer accepts arbitrary sequence of 300 dimension vectors with an output dimension of ten. The FC layer accepts input dimension of ten and outputs a dimension one scalar. Finally, the scalar is passed through a Sigmoid function to map into the probability space indicating the probability of the tweet pertaining to a disaster.\n","\n","A Mean-Square-Error (MSE) loss was used as the criterion and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) (Kingma & Ba, 2017) is used in the LSTM model.\n","\n","\n","## Discussion\n","### CPU vs GPU\n","To utilize the acceleration provided by a GPU, the data should be batched to allow for parallelized processing of multiple data points (i.e., tweets). Unlike a convolutional model often used in computer vision, the LSTM is sequential model and cannot be meaningfully parallelized for a single data point. I opted out from using the GPU because 1) SpaCy `en_core_web_lg` pipeline is optimized for CPU, 2) copying data between CPU and GPU adds too much overhead for how small this dataset is, and 3) batching the tweets proves to be a challenge.\n","\n","### Batching vs Unbatching\n","To utilize GPUs, batching had to be done with the data. However, padding had to be added because of the varying lengths of each tweet. I chose to pad with a vector of zeros which maps to a space character. When padding the dataset with space characters, the model fails to understand the spaces as null and attempts to interpret the spaces resulting in the model parameters being zeroed out during the backpropagation step and constantly inferences to a value of zero thus losses its inferencing power.\n","\n","### Hyperparameter tuning the learning rate\n","The Adam optimizer has multiple hyperparameters that can be adjusted and the main one is the learning rate. Without systematic hyperparameter tuning I tested a comically large learning rate of 300 and and small learning rate or 0.001. Due to the lack of batching, the parameters are updated for each data point used for training and thus a large learning rate constantly overshoots the optimal parameter value. Instead, a small learning rate is shown to perform much better and is sufficient enough that signs of overfitting starts showing after one or two epoch(s).\n","\n","![Train Loss vs Validation Loss](https://www.kaggleusercontent.com/kf/209127182/eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiLCJlbmMiOiJBMTI4Q0JDLUhTMjU2In0..7RGNCq2PeJo-FZ6mmDNNaw.2p09SjEiaYSXXpWWOt3ECZ67mLuL-DN98x-jFIRiNrP8__SvwzHQZuh5P6k5kEYl3xK32WakvgjiA3nf-jGO3HT6n9KINmAxqn5KiMakeAttzyfUWC_w_gY8b968ZL2B6sBrA5wpote0ehGa0p5Kmte0_kPuEY7MVL0fpZ7pZwLoKqXwTX7vjpP-DlLGI3pWWHaxbKhwnIuJAg02BYu-2C04TIERG9i5TBvoYTCyA_gcehPeBc_NjrQIJQA18O_8UQ9oy9DcQwrDq5mrfNQOyDoeGbyxcSMNKLfJU-3T-W_DofiUHFqGAiWoVG1IbyLNAP4hth5PwVN0ilx_T-m_CX2cbbLuTggAvgUwfuYskTojP5KvfMi-asoozN-6zQen61ah29en5Y8OWUL3Jt52fW0h6hs7TINndcZfYx6vxdWf4h49CATELSA_tGiKxM89vsE7ZJ2oNc9Vn__AtkkxIrm4jRZfMEJso9YXcVIBcZBhB8xFxMNnFDhhUCEPYMce3DHgZXUW8eEG-yi4XpGEuVEt5mo1FWsSXbEYVuBqQPicmUX4ZbpjVISapvsQC__5tnYC6kd5j9cSB7R5E_HJ8wx5Yykbkf2ZcBCFnfB19KjAcsfkSourqysIVkNW1kKi.zCL0r__229ksbNBmi7e9sQ/__results___files/__results___7_1.png)\n","\n","## Conclusion\n","In conclusion, the LSTM model made parallelization more challenging and considering the overhead introduced when training with GPU, training and inferencing with CPU was the better approach. Even though padding the varying lengths of tweets proves to be challenging, there are options to still be batch train the model such as early halting the training when encountering a token of all zeros. Using the Adam optimizer and a small learning rate, the model is able to achieve F1 score of 0.803 with a training time of aprpoximatly 7.5 minutes. To push the model performance even further, a few suggested improvement is proposed below. However, this simple model shows the value that a model with memory is capable of extracting further information that a simpler model such as bag-of-words is not able to achieve. \n","\n","## Future Improvements\n","- Explore other vectorization methods\n","    - The pipeline model used is 382MB and takes some time to download/load. For a more portable inteligent device such as a IoT device, the storage requirement could make this model unfeasible. Thus, it would worth looking into utilizing SpaCy's other pretrained pipelines or another encoding method.\n","- Explore the use of transformers\n","    - Transformers are shown tremendous progress in the field of NLP and this is a valuable avenue to explore and compare performance with this simple LSTM model. Additionally, various pretrained transformer models have been published and shared freely in an open-source manner. To be able to further train these published model could help fine tune the performance of these published models.\n","- Explore how to batch train and utilize GPU\n","    - To be able to batch these varying lengths of tweets have proved challenging and could lead to errors if proper precautions were not considered. One suggested approach is to pad all tweets with a specialized sentinel vector and terminate the LSTM sequential training of each token when the sentinel is encountered.\n","- Explore how to deploy the trained model in an application that can be used to demo\n","    - Publish the model using some sort of interactive applet such that the model can be tested with other texts. \n","- Improve data cleaning and extraction\n","    - In this notebook, the NLP processing was essentially offloaded to the SpaCy library and their methodologies. Certain special characters remained in the the tweets and was vectorized accordingly. It would be valuable to create an alternative dataset of which the special characters such as emojis or emoticons were removed and train the LSTM model on these data. Through this comparison we could be able to hypothesize the amount of information informing whether the tweet pertains to a disaster is provided by these non-traditional characters.\n","- Systematic tune the hyperparamters\n","    - Use a tool such as RayTune to systematically tune the hyperparameter values and consider the impact of learning rate to the outcome of the model's inference power.\n","    - Also systematically tune and discover whether additional LSTM layers or LSTM hidden output dimensions could improve the model's performance.\n","- Permute the order of the training dataset\n","    - The order of the training dataset is static in this model and because of LSTM's memory, the order of which each training data is introduce could impact the outcome of model's parameters. Permute the order of the dataset and test if the model retains its inference power.\n","- Test removing lemmatizer\n","    - Considering that these are tweets thus proper English grammar may be lacking; there may be value in training on non-lemmatized tweets.\n","- Test training with increased LSTM layers and hidden output dimensions\n","\n","## References\n","Kingma, D.
