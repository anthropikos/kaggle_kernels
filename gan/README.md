## Download the dataset
Use the shell script in the `data/` directory to download and unzip the dataset.

You will need to have [Kaggle API](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api#api-credentials) setup. Follow [this documentation](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api#getting-started-installation-&-authentication) to setup Kaggle API.


## Todo
- [ ] Fix the plotting utility because the ImageDataset accessor now returns a Tensor.
